Write a description of the website:

My user-reviews website is a site that allows users to write personalized reviews about the subject (Julian Bossiere).  Users are able to select their own star-rating, create their own title, create a body, then submit.  This data adds to the average rating of the subject, and their input gets added below the input box - where they themselves, as well as other users can upvote, downvote, and delete reviews.

Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.

I used many online resources as well as a bit of collaborating with classmates.  I believe I recieved the most tips/help from Arvin and SangOuk. 

Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what?

As much as I think it would've been cool to, no I did not.

Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?

Most definitely at least 24 hours.

Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

Some aspects were again a bit unclear, though maybe that is by design.  I had the most trouble with figuring out exactly what I needed in my <head> section, as well as figuring out how to do the average star value, and how to increment.  I like the idea of having us learn to use our resources to solve these problems ourselves, but sometimes it does feel like A LOT of time wasted on trying to figure out one little thing.
